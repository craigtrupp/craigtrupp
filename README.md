I'm a data enthusiast currently looking to transition from a predominantly consulting role to a Data Engineer/Analyst. With a background spanning from web development 🕸️ to film production 🎥, I've had an unique opportunity to get first hand experience in diverging interests. Most recently, I was working in technical consulting and documentation with a slight devops hat as well in triaging API and application related issues for customers using our risk management software products.
