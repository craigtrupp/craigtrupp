I'm a data enthusiast currently looking to transition from a predominantly consulting role to a Data Engineer/Analyst. With a background spanning from web development 🕸️ to film production 🎥, I've had an unique opportunity to get first hand experience in diverging interests. Most recently, I was working in technical consulting and documentation with a slight devops hat as well in triaging API and application related issues for customers using our risk management software products. 

- I'm currently working on Data Engineering and API/BackEnd principles as well as my favorite .... SQL 🗄️
- Next, I'm hoping to tie together a few CyberSecurity Items and IT Automation w/Python
- Please see some of my pinned repositories below for recent Database Engineering, Data Analysis, & SQL Case Studies which were quite enjoyable!
